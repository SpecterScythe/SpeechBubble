The other contributer is also me, go their page and the bio you will understand, anyway i know coding not github so the release.zip in the files section is the linux release, however the one in the release section is the windows release. on the bottom of this is a quick controls guide

this is a speechbubble application it uses text to speech for anyone who needs a speechbubble you have a few different voice options including languages though not many yet, it aounds better then microsoft david and zira. but a step below elevenlabs

i made this because i dont talk so i needed a way to talk, the linux one does not have twitch support built in yet, the windows one does, what that means is that you can set up the speechbubble on windows so that everything you input into it for
it to say will also be chatted in twitch on your channel, including auto thanking raids and subs if it works correctly, right now im doing something else so im not online much however if you download this and find a bug just dm me on twitter.

though i dont have a privacy policy set up, i think this should work

"nothing that the user enters into the application such as, (twitch oauth),(twitch username),(likewise information entered by the user), will be used for anything else other then to allow the application to work, so using the oauth to allow for
auto chatting what you say, it is never stored off of the users computer so the information you eneter is just stored in the local appdata folder from windows, i will never take any information from any user, and the only way the oauth would be
used externally would be when interacting with the twitch server to allow for the auto chat what you say"

while this does not cover everything it should be good enough, and you can take any rational assumption from said privacy policy as being part of it, such as becuase i said "likewise information entered by the user" that can refer to what you enter
into the speechBubble of course none of that information is ever stored, unless you choose to save it and assign it to a key like saying something when you press 1, then of course it will need to save it but only locally in the appData folder


controls, aside from the basic obvious settings buttons ect, you can so long as in the settings you enter your twitch channel name, can open a transparent chat window, very usful for single monitor usages, and you can use obs application capture so you can have your chat displayed on stream, make sure to use windows 10 capture through obs for it to work, if not then windows 8 capture. 

you can give chatters of your choice a voice, go into the settings and add their username in the allowed user list, save and then when they chat it will say it through a different tts then yours. 

it will ask for channel oauth and name, you dont need to give it, feel free to look through the source code if you dont trust it, but the basic stuff for this should work without it though i have not tested it

you can have quick access voice sayings, if i remember correctly if you turn on or off numlock it will enable and disable this feature, and if its enabled then if you type something in, then press control plus any of the 1-0 keys it will add that text to to a viewable textbox then the next time you press those numbers it will say whats in the textbox

if you press ctrl+Q if it does not speak whats inside the textbox it will make sure to say it, just as a backup just in case

press control and ? to open the settings screen.

you can change the font size, speechbubble and text color in the settings

it does a few more things its just been awhile so i dont remeber them all
