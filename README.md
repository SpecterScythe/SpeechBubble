The other contributer is also me, go their page and the bio you will understand, anyway i know coding not github so the release.zip in the files section is the linux release, however the one in the release section is the windows release.

this is a speechbubble application it uses text to speech for anyone who needs a speechbubble you have a few different voice options including languages though not many yet, it aounds better then microsoft david and zira. but a step below elevenlabs

i made this because i dont talk so i needed a way to talk, the linux one does not have twitch support built in yet, the windows one does, what that means is that you can set up the speechbubble on windows so that everything you input into it for
it to say will also be chatted in twitch on your channel, including auto thanking raids and subs if it works correctly, right now im doing something else so im not online much however if you download this and find a bug just dm me on twitter.

though i dont have a privacy policy set up, i think thid should work

"nothing that the user enters into the application such as, (twitch oauth),(twitch username),(likewise information entered by the user), will be used for anything else other then to allow the application to work, so using the oauth to allow for
auto chatting what you say, it is never stored off of the users computer so the information you eneter is just stored in the local appdata folder from windows, i will never take any information from any user, and the only way the oauth would be
used externally would be when interacting with the twitch server to allow for the auto chat what you say"

while this does not cover everything it should be good enough, and you can take any rational assumption from said privacy policy as being part of it, such as becuase i said "likewise information entered by the user" that can refer to what you enter
into the speechBubble of course none of that information is ever stored, unless you choose to save it and assign it to a key like saying something when you press 1, then of course it will need to save it but only locally in the appData folder
