# SpeechBubble
A SpeechBubble app i made for myself to use for/with twitch

open the app wait a second a chrome driver will load then you will see the speechbubble, click and drag it to move it around, when it first opens it will open to a settings menu please take note of the keybinds listed in said settings, past that just look around and find stuff, in the settings you need to enter a twitch Oauth token and a channel name to use twitch integration such as channel raids, auto chatting what you add in the bubble, and giving chat tts, dont worrry nothing will leave your device but if you dont like to just download the exe, then make it youtself just copy the code and paste it into visual studio and run it as it should work like that to.

if you dont know what a twitch oauth token us or how to get one look up "twitch tmi oauth" and what should be one of the first results is a website used to generate twich oauth tokens

two things if you want to read this code, the first thing is go to this Url https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes and look at the virtual keycodes because i was sort of lazy when making this i did not rename the keys, so Key_V might be Key_B so just look and dont assume VK_CAPITAL is actually capslock, two is you might find some slashed out notes like //for some reason this form opens twice, you can ignore those i was just to lazy to remove them all the main problems i could find such as that have been fixed


Linux version in development when released you need to have chromedriver and dotnet 7 installed to run it
